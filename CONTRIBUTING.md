# Contributing to COG

Thank you for your interest in contributing to COG! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huytieu/COG-second-brain/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description of the problem or suggestion
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Obsidian version, AI agent used: Claude Code/Kiro/Other)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for new features or improvements:

1. Create an issue with the "enhancement" label
2. Describe the feature and why it would be useful
3. Provide examples or mockups if applicable
4. Be open to discussion and feedback

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Ensure your changes align with COG's philosophy:
   - Simplicity over complexity
   - Plain text over proprietary formats
   - Self-evolving intelligence
   - Verification-first approach
4. **If your PR changes the framework** (skills, docs, scripts):
   - Bump the version in `COG-VERSION` (e.g., `3.2.0` → `3.3.0`)
   - Add a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - If adding a new file, add it to the `FRAMEWORK_FILES` array in `cog-update.sh`
   - Update `marketplace-entry.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version fields
   - Keep the support matrix truthful in `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/AGENT-SUPPORT.md`
   - Run `./scripts/validate-agent-surface.sh` before opening the PR

#### Making Changes

1. **Worker Agents**: New agents should be added to `.claude/agents/` with this format:
   - YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `model` (use `sonnet` for I/O tasks, `opus` only if reasoning is required)
   - Clear capability list and output rule
   - Add the file to `FRAMEWORK_FILES` in `cog-update.sh`
   - Document in `AGENTS.md` under "Worker Agents"
2. **Skills**: New skills should be added in every surface that claims to support them:
   - `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md` - Claude Code format (required; include `roles` and `integrations` in frontmatter)
   - `AGENTS.md` - Universal documentation (required)
   - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Packaged skill manifest (required)
   - `.kiro/powers/cog-[name]/POWER.md` - Kiro format (if Kiro supports the skill)
   - `.gemini/commands/[name].toml` + `.gemini/skills/[name].md` - Gemini CLI format (if Gemini supports the skill)
   - If the skill is role-specific, add it to relevant role packs in `.claude/roles/`
2. **Templates**: Follow existing YAML frontmatter conventions
3. **Documentation**: Update README.md if adding major features
4. **Examples**: Provide examples of your feature in action

#### Code Style

- **Markdown**: Use consistent formatting
- **YAML**: Follow existing metadata structure
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names

#### Testing

Before submitting:

1. Test your command/feature in actual COG setup
2. Ensure it works with existing commands
3. Verify it doesn't break existing functionality
4. Check that documentation is accurate
5. Run `./scripts/validate-agent-surface.sh` for packaging/manifest consistency

#### Submitting

1. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages
2. Push to your fork
3. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Examples or screenshots if applicable
   - Testing you've done

## Types of Contributions We're Looking For

### High Priority

- **New Skills**: Useful skills for common workflows (add in all agent formats)
- **Agent Format Support**: Improve support for additional AI agents
- **Documentation**: Tutorials, examples, use cases
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixes for reported issues

### Medium Priority

- **Specialized Skills**: New skills for specific domains
- **Integration Scripts**: Scripts for connecting COG with other tools
- **Workflow Examples**: Real-world workflow demonstrations
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimizations for large vaults

### Welcome But Lower Priority

- **UI/Visual**: Visual improvements (COG is text-first)
- **Platform-Specific**: Features for specific platforms (keep it universal)
- **Advanced Features**: Complex features that increase learning curve

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a test Obsidian vault
3. Copy COG files to your test vault
4. Make changes and test
5. Submit PR when ready
