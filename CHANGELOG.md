# Changelog

All notable changes to COG (Cognition + Obsidian + Git) will be documented in this file.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Specialist Sessions, People CRM & Worker Agents

COG now includes a worker agent architecture (inspired by [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) specialist sessions and [garrytan/gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) knowledge patterns), a people CRM system with tiered enrichment for progressive team knowledge, and operational protocols that make multi-agent workflows faster and more reliable.

### Added

#### Worker Agent Architecture (`.claude/agents/`)
- **`worker-data-collector`** — Structured extraction from GitHub, Slack, Jira, Linear, or file system (Sonnet)
- **`worker-researcher`** — Web research with source citations and evidence extraction (Sonnet)
- **`worker-file-ops`** — Vault file operations, metadata updates, profile maintenance (Sonnet)
- **`worker-executor`** — Pre-approved mutations: Jira transitions, Linear updates, API calls (Sonnet)
- **`worker-publisher`** — Publishing to Slack, Confluence, Notion, webhooks (Sonnet)
- **`brief-people-updater`** — Batch-update people profiles from meetings, briefs, and Slack data (Sonnet)

#### People CRM System
- **`05-knowledge/people/README.md`** — People CRM documentation with design principles, file naming, citation format
- **`06-templates/people-profile-template.md`** — Two-layer profile template (Compiled Truth + append-only Timeline)
- Progressive, evidence-based profiles built from meetings, Slack, PRs, and daily interactions
- Mandatory source citations with confidence levels (high/medium/low)

#### Operational Protocols in CLAUDE.md
- **Model Routing** — Sonnet workers for data collection/publishing, Opus lead for reasoning/synthesis
- **Worker Output Rule** — Workers write to `/tmp/` files and return only a status + path (eliminates slow token generation)
- **Brain-First Knowledge Protocol** — Read `05-knowledge/` before answering people/project/strategy questions
- **Citation Rule** — Source attribution required for factual statements in durable notes

### Changed (includes v3.4.1 packaging fixes)

- **`README.md`** — Added Worker Agents section, People CRM section, updated vault structure and mermaid diagrams, added agent support matrix
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Added Worker Agents documentation, People CRM commands, updated vault structure with people/ and agents/
- **`SETUP.md`** — Added worker agents and people CRM to directory structure, updated skill counts
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Major additions: model routing, worker output rule, brain-first protocol, citation rule, knowledge system in vault structure
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Added agent contribution guidelines and coding conventions for `.claude/agents/`
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Bumped version, added agents metadata, updated architecture description
- **`marketplace-entry.json`** — Bumped version to 3.5.0
- **`cog-update.sh`** — Added 8 new framework files (6 agents + people README + profile template)
- **`COG-VERSION`** — Bumped 3.4.0 → 3.5.0
- **`docs/AGENT-SUPPORT.md`** — Canonical support matrix for all agent surfaces
- **`scripts/validate-agent-surface.sh`** — Release/install validator
- **`.github/MARKETPLACE.md`** — Rewritten for current package model

### Design Decisions
- **gstack-inspired specialist lanes**: Capture, Synthesis, Publishing, Team Intelligence, Repo Maintenance — clear operating gears instead of one generic agent session
- **Sonnet for I/O, Opus for thinking**: Workers handle data-heavy tasks cheaply and in parallel; the lead session does reasoning and editorial judgment
- **File-based worker output**: Writing to `/tmp/` then reading is instant; generating thousands of tokens as agent output takes minutes
- **People profiles are append-only**: Timeline history is never rewritten — only the Compiled Truth section updates as understanding evolves
- **Citation-first culture**: Every factual claim in knowledge notes traces to a source with confidence level

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### PM Workflow Skills & Auto-Research

COG now includes a complete product management workflow (6 skills) and a deep strategic research engine. PM skills cover the full lifecycle from PRD to release notes to knowledge base maintenance, with multi-tracker support (Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira) and optional Confluence/Notion publishing.

### Added

#### Auto-Research Skill
- **`auto-research`** — Deep strategic research engine inspired by Karpathy's autoresearch
  - Decomposes strategic questions into 5-7 parallel research threads
  - Spawns parallel agents (team mode) for simultaneous web research
  - Synthesizes into actionable analysis with scenarios, options, and recommendations
  - Always includes emerging tech thread for pre-mainstream concepts
  - Saves to `05-knowledge/research/`

#### PM Workflow Skills (6 new skills)
- **`create-user-story`** — Create user stories with duplicate checking
  - Multi-tracker: Linear (MCP), GitHub Issues (`gh` CLI), Jira (API)
  - Standard As a/I want/So that format with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
  - Automatic duplicate detection before creation
- **`generate-prd`** — Draft product requirement documents
  - Standard sections: Problem, Goals, Non-goals, User workflows, Requirements, Risks, Metrics
  - Approval gate before any external publishing
  - Saves to `04-projects/[project]/PRDs/`
- **`generate-release-notes`** — Generate release notes from any source
  - GitHub milestones, Linear cycles, or manual input
  - Auto-categorizes: Enhancements, Technical Improvements, Bug Fixes
  - Saves to `04-projects/[project]/releases/`
- **`export-open-issues`** — Audit and export open issues
  - Multi-tracker support with stale issue detection
  - Priority distribution and assignee load analysis
  - Saves structured report to `04-projects/[project]/audits/`
- **`publish-to-confluence`** — Publish vault markdown to Confluence
  - Create or update pages with approval gate
  - Requires Confluence integration active
- **`update-knowledge-base`** — Maintain product knowledge base
  - Accepts feature updates, release data, or both
  - Cross-references PRDs and release notes
  - Optional Confluence/Notion sync with approval

#### Skill Metadata
- All 7 new skills have `roles` and `integrations` fields in YAML frontmatter
- PM skills: `roles: [product-manager, engineering-lead, founder]`
- Auto-research: `roles: [product-manager, engineering-lead, founder, all]`

### Changed

#### Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Added PM Workflow Skills section, Strategic Research section, updated mermaid diagrams, vault structure (17 skills), roadmap
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Added 7 new skill commands with full documentation, PM Workflow lifecycle description
- **`SETUP.md`** — Updated skill counts (10 → 17), updated directory structure
- **`GEMINI.md`** — Updated available skills list
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Updated skill count to 17
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — No structural changes needed (existing conventions apply)
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This entry

#### Version & Metadata
- **`COG-VERSION`** — Bumped 3.3.0 → 3.4.0
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Bumped version, updated skill count to 17, added 7 new skills
- **`marketplace-entry.json`** — Bumped version to 3.4.0
- **`cog-update.sh`** — Added 7 new skills to FRAMEWORK_FILES array

### Design Decisions
- **Multi-tracker architecture**: PM skills check `MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` and work with Linear, GitHub, or Jira — graceful degradation when trackers are unavailable
- **Approval gates**: Publishing to external services (Confluence, Notion) always requires explicit user confirmation
- **Vault-first output**: All PM artifacts save to vault (`04-projects/`, `05-knowledge/`) before any external publishing
- **PM lifecycle flow**: Skills designed as a pipeline: Research → PRD → Stories → Development → Release Notes → KB Update

## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Role Packs & Integration Discovery

COG now matches your role during onboarding to personalize skill recommendations and integration suggestions. A PM and an engineer see different skill priorities. New roles can be added by dropping a file.

### Added

#### Role Packs (`.claude/roles/`)
- **7 role pack files** — each defines per-role skill recommendations and integration needs:
  - `_template.md` — starter for custom roles
  - `product-manager.md` — skills: team-brief, comprehensive-analysis, meeting-transcript, daily-brief, braindump, etc. Integrations: GitHub, Linear, Slack, PostHog, Notion, HackMD
  - `engineering-lead.md` — engineering-focused with team management emphasis. Integrations: GitHub, Linear, Slack, PostHog
  - `engineer.md` — individual contributor focus. Integrations: GitHub
  - `designer.md` — design and UX research focus. Integrations: Slack, Notion
  - `founder.md` — all skills, all integrations recommended
  - `marketer.md` — growth and content focus. Integrations: Slack, Notion, PostHog
- Each role pack contains YAML frontmatter with `role_id`, `display_name`, and `aliases` for fuzzy matching during onboarding

#### Onboarding Enhancements
- **Step 5.5 — Role Pack Matching**: After extracting role text, scans `.claude/roles/*.md` for matching `role_id` or `aliases`. Presents role-specific skill and integration recommendations
- **Step 5.6 — Integration Discovery**: Presents role pack's recommended integrations with role-specific explanations. Generates `00-inbox/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` with Active/Disabled sections
- **Updated MY-PROFILE.md template**: Now includes `role_pack` in YAML frontmatter
- **Updated WELCOME-TO-COG.md template**: New "Skills for Your Role" section with role-ordered skills, and "Your Integrations" section

#### Skill Metadata
- All 10 skills now have `roles` and `integrations` fields in YAML frontmatter
  - Core skills (onboarding, braindump, daily-brief, etc.): `roles: [all]`
  - Team skills (team-brief, comprehensive-analysis): `roles: [product-manager, engineering-lead, founder]`
  - Meeting-transcript: `roles: [product-manager, engineering-lead, founder, designer]`

#### Framework Configuration
- **`CLAUDE.md`** rewritten as universal framework file with Role Packs and Integration Preferences sections (no longer personal config)

### Changed

#### Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Added "Role Packs" section, updated vault structure diagram with `.claude/roles/`, updated roadmap
- **`SETUP.md`** — Updated skill counts, added role packs to onboarding output, added MY-INTEGRATIONS.md
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Updated onboarding command with role matching and integration discovery, added team intelligence skills, updated vault structure and configuration section
- **`GEMINI.md`** — Updated vault structure with role packs and integrations file
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Updated skill frontmatter convention to include `roles` and `integrations` fields, added role pack contribution guidelines
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This entry

#### Version & Metadata
- **`COG-VERSION`** — Bumped 3.2.0 → 3.3.0
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Bumped version, updated skill count to 10, added `rolePacks: 7` metadata
- **`marketplace-entry.json`** — Bumped version to 3.3.0
- **`cog-update.sh`** — Added 7 role pack files, CLAUDE.md, and 3 team intelligence skills to FRAMEWORK_FILES array

### Design Decisions
- **File-based role packs**: New roles added by dropping a `.md` file — no code changes needed
- **Alias-based matching**: Fuzzy matching via aliases handles variations like "PM", "product lead", "head of product"
- **Integration discovery during onboarding**: Rather than skills failing at runtime, integrations are configured upfront
- **CLAUDE.md as framework file**: Moves from personal config to universal instructions that work for any user

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Upstream Update System

Users who fork or clone COG can now safely pull framework updates (skills, docs, scripts) without risking merge conflicts with their personal content.

### Added

#### Update Tooling
- **`cog-update.sh`** — Interactive bash script for updating framework files
  - `--check`: See available updates without making changes
  - `--dry-run`: Preview what would change
  - `--force`: Update all framework files at once
  - Interactive mode: Per-file prompts with diff, backup, and skip options
- **`/update-cog` skill** — Available in all 4 agent formats:
  - `.claude/skills/update-cog/SKILL.md` (Claude Code)
  - `.kiro/powers/cog-update/POWER.md` (Kiro)
  - `.gemini/commands/update-cog.toml` + `.gemini/skills/update-cog.md` (Gemini CLI)
  - `AGENTS.md` updated with `/update-cog` command (OpenAI Codex, others)
- **`COG-VERSION`** — Single-line version tracking file (currently `3.2.0`)

#### Content/Framework Separation
- **`.gitkeep` files** in all 15 content directories — preserves directory structure in upstream while `.gitignore` excludes user content
- **`.gitignore` rewrite** — Content folder ignores now active by default with `.gitkeep` whitelisting

#### Directory Structure Preservation
- `.gitkeep` added to: `00-inbox/`, `01-daily/`, `01-daily/briefs/`, `01-daily/checkins/`, `02-personal/`, `02-personal/braindumps/`, `03-professional/`, `03-professional/braindumps/`, `04-projects/`, `05-knowledge/`, `05-knowledge/consolidated/`, `05-knowledge/patterns/`, `05-knowledge/timeline/`, `05-knowledge/booklets/`, `06-templates/`

### Changed

#### Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Added "Keeping COG Updated" section, FAQ entries for updates, updated roadmap
- **`SETUP.md`** — Added comprehensive "Keeping COG Updated" section with all 3 update methods
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Added `/update-cog` command, version & updates configuration section
- **`GEMINI.md`** — Added `/update-cog` to available skills list
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Added version bump protocol to "Before You Start" section
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This entry

#### Integration
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — Added update-cog skill, bumped version to 3.2.0
- **`marketplace-entry.json`** — Bumped version to 3.2.0
- **`.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md`** — Added "Keeping COG Updated" to welcome guide template
- **`.kiro/powers/cog-onboarding/POWER.md`** — Added update mention to wrap-up section

### Removed
- **`example-vault/`** — Removed empty directory (contained only `.DS_Store`), replaced by `.gitkeep` files

### Design Decisions
- **Remote name `cog-upstream`**: Works for both fork and clone users without conflicting with `origin`
- **`git checkout <remote>/<branch> -- <file>`**: Surgical file replacement with zero conflict risk
- **Self-updating script**: `cog-update.sh` is in the framework file list, so it updates itself
- **Active .gitignore**: Content folder ignores are on by default so new users get safe defaults

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### Major Architecture Overhaul

This release represents a complete restructuring of COG to follow proven subagent architecture patterns, emphasizing separation of concerns and configuration-as-knowledge principles.

### Added

#### Onboarding System
- **New `/onboarding` command** - First-run setup that personalizes COG in ~2 minutes
  - Asks 6 essential questions: name, role, interests, news sources, projects, competitive watchlist
  - Creates readable markdown profile files in vault
  - No JSON configuration files - everything is human-readable markdown

#### Configuration as Knowledge
- **`00-inbox/MY-PROFILE.md`** - User's basic info, role, and active projects
- **`00-inbox/MY-INTERESTS.md`** - Topics of interest and preferred news sources
- **`03-professional/COMPETITIVE-WATCHLIST.md`** - Companies/people to track
- **`04-projects/[project]/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`** - Per-project overview documents
- **`00-inbox/WELCOME-TO-COG.md`** - Personalized welcome guide (auto-generated)

All configuration is now part of the knowledge base - searchable, linkable, and editable like any other note.

#### Subagent Architecture
- **`.claude/subagents/brain-dump-analyst.md`** - Specialized subagent for braindump analysis
  - Stream-of-consciousness processing
  - Domain classification
  - Theme extraction
  - Competitive intelligence detection
  - Structured output generation

- **`.claude/subagents/news-curator.md`** - Specialized subagent for news curation
  - Verified news research (7-day freshness requirement)
  - Multi-source cross-referencing
  - Strategic relevance analysis
  - Personalized briefing generation

### Changed

#### Command Architecture
Commands are now **thin orchestration layers** that delegate to specialized subagents:

**`/braindump` - Redesigned**
- Collects user's stream-of-consciousness input
- Asks for domain classification
- **Delegates ALL processing to brain-dump-analyst subagent**
- Confirms completion and shows summary
- No longer handles analysis directly

**`/daily-brief` - Redesigned**
- Reads user profile files (MY-PROFILE.md, MY-INTERESTS.md)
- **Delegates ALL news curation to news-curator subagent**
- Confirms completion and shows executive summary
- No longer searches or curates news directly

**`/weekly-checkin` - Simplified**
- Guided conversational reflection
- Direct document generation based on user responses
- Pattern identification through conversation
- No template dependency

#### Configuration Philosophy
- **Before**: Hidden JSON config files (`.claude/config/user-config.json`)
- **After**: Markdown notes in vault that are part of knowledge base
- Benefits:
  - Human-readable and directly editable
  - Searchable in Obsidian
  - Linkable from other notes
  - Version controlled with Git
  - Can include personal notes and context

### Removed

- **Deleted `templates/` directory entirely**
  - `templates/braindump-template.md`
  - `templates/daily-brief-template.md`
  - `templates/weekly-checkin-template.md`

- **Removed JSON configuration system**
  - `.claude/config/` directory and all JSON files

- **Eliminated template dependencies**
  - All content now dynamically generated based on context
  - Templates were static; dynamic generation is more flexible

### Architecture Benefits

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Commands**: Simple orchestrators that handle user interaction and delegation
- **Subagents**: Complex processors with detailed analysis frameworks and verification protocols
- Clear responsibility boundaries make system easier to understand and extend

#### Maintainability
- Commands are now < 200 lines (vs 250+ before)
- Complex logic isolated in specialized subagents
- Changes to analysis logic don't affect command structure
- Easy to add new subagents without modifying commands

#### Transparency
- All configuration visible and editable as markdown notes
- No hidden JSON files to debug
- User can see exactly what COG knows about them
- Configuration becomes part of their thinking/knowledge

#### Extensibility
- New subagents can be added by creating new `.md` files in `.claude/subagents/`
- Commands can delegate to multiple subagents as needed
- Subagents can collaborate by reading each other's outputs

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Updated to reflect:
  - Subagent architecture explanation
  - Simplified installation (no templates to copy)
  - 2-minute onboarding flow
  - Configuration-as-knowledge philosophy

- **New CHANGELOG.md** - This file, documenting all changes

### Migration Guide

If upgrading from v1.x:

1. **Remove old configuration**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .claude/config/
   ```

2. **Remove templates**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf templates/
   ```

3. **Pull new structure**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Run onboarding**:
   ```
   /onboarding
   ```
   This will create your new markdown-based profile.

5. **Your existing notes are safe** - Only `.claude/` structure changed, all your braindumps, briefs, and check-ins remain unchanged.

### Technical Details

#### File Changes
- Modified: `.claude/commands/braindump.md`
- Modified: `.claude/commands/daily-brief.md`
- Modified: `.claude/commands/weekly-checkin.md`
- Modified: `README.md`
- Added: `.claude/commands/onboarding.md`
- Added: `.claude/subagents/brain-dump-analyst.md`
- Added: `.claude/subagents/news-curator.md`
- Deleted: `templates/` (entire directory)
- Deleted: `.claude/config/` (entire directory)

#### Breaking Changes
- **Configuration format changed** - Old JSON configs no longer used
- **Template system removed** - Commands that relied on templates now generate content dynamically
- **Subagent delegation required** - Commands expect subagents to exist in `.claude/subagents/`

#### Backward Compatibility
- **Existing markdown files unchanged** - All your notes, briefs, braindumps remain compatible
- **Command names unchanged** - `/braindump`, `/daily-brief`, etc. work the same from user perspective
- **Directory structure unchanged** - `00-inbox/`, `01-daily/`, etc. remain the same

### Philosophy

This release embraces two key principles:

1. **Configuration is Knowledge** - Your preferences, interests, and setup are part of your second brain, not hidden config files.

2. **Commands Orchestrate, Subagents Process** - Commands handle user interaction and context gathering; specialized subagents handle complex analysis, verification, and generation.

These principles make COG more transparent, maintainable, and aligned with the "second brain" philosophy of making all knowledge visible and editable.
